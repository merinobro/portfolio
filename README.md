Hi & welcome to my Web Developer portfolio website! 

It is a clean & simple website employing semantic HTML as well as SCSS. From a simple landing page, you have access to the sections "about", "work" and "contact" through the top navigation. The work section showcases examples of my work as flip cards, this section was built utilizing flexbox. 

I tried to keep everything concise and to the point, both in terms of written content as well as in terms of the design and navigation, to help potential employers as well as fellow coders interested in cooperation to quickly get to the information they need.

Enjoy, and if you have any feedback I certainly welcome it â€“ feel free to make use of the contact form ;-)

Cheers,
Ruppert
